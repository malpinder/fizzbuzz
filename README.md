About
=====

This is a somewhat unusual implementation of the standard FizzBuzz, as spec'ed by [Blackboard](http://blackboard-projects.herokuapp.com/projects/1).

It uses explicit division & inspection of the remainder to work out if a number is divisible by another. Using `.remainder` would be far more efficient, but this is intended to demonstrate that there are multiple solutions to problems, some of which are quicker or more readable than others.
